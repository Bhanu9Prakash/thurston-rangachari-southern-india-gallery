The Malay\r\nuse of the word is, as a rule, restricted to Tamils. The name is a form\r\nof Kalinga, a very ancient name for the region known as the Northern\r\nCircars, i.e., the Telugu coast of the Bay of\r\nBengal.”9 It is recorded by Dr. N. Anandale that the\r\n[xxiv]phrase Orang Kling Islam (i.e., a\r\nMuhammadan from the Madras coast) occurs in Patani Malay. He further\r\ninforms us10 that among the Labbai Muhammadans of the Madura\r\ncoast, there are “certain men who make a livelihood by shooting\r\npigeons with blow-guns. According to my Labbai informants, the\r\n‘guns’ are purchased by them in Singapore from Bugis\r\ntraders. There is still a considerable trade, although diminished,\r\nbetween Kilakarai and the ports of Burma and the Straits Settlements.\r\nIt is carried on entirely by Muhammadans in native sailing vessels, and\r\na large proportion of the Musalmans of Kilakarai have visited Penang\r\nand Singapore. It is not difficult to find among them men who can speak\r\nStraits Malay. The local name for the blow-gun is senguttān, and\r\nis derived in popular etymology from the Tamil sen (above) and kutu (to\r\nstab). I have little doubt that it is really a corruption of the Malay\r\nname of the weapon sumpitan.”",

		"description": "“Udayas are Lingāyats in religion, and carry the\r\nSivalinga—the Siva image—tied round their necks. They claim\r\nto be superior to all the other Badagas, and [73]are\r\nregarded as such. They are priests to all the Badagas of the\r\nLingāyat class, and are strict vegetarians. They do not intermarry\r\nwith any of the other high caste Badaga sects. Udaya was, and is the\r\ntitle assumed by the Maisūr Rājas, and those Badagas, by\r\nbeing thus designated as a caste, claim superior blood in their\r\nveins.” The Lingāyat Badagas are commonly called Lingakutti.\r\n“Next in rank come the Hāruvas. From their name being so\r\nclosely connected with the Āryas—the respectable—and\r\nfrom their habit of wearing the Brāhmanical thread, we are\r\nwarranted in believing that they must originally have been the poor\r\nBrāhman priests of the Badagas that migrated to this country (the\r\nNīlgiris), though they have now got themselves closely mingled\r\nwith the Badagas. These Hāruvas are also strict vegetarians, and\r\nact as priests.” It has been suggested that the Hāruvas\r\n(jumper) derive their name from the fire-walking ceremony, which they\r\nperform periodically. A further, and more probable suggestion has been\r\nmade to me that Hāruva comes from a Canarese word meaning to beg\r\nor pray; hence one who begs or prays, and so a Brāhman. The\r\nCanarese Basava Purāna frequently uses the word in sense.\r\n“The Adhikāris are to a certain extent vegetarians. The\r\nother two high castes, and of course the low caste Toreyas also, have\r\nno objection of any kind to eating flesh. It is also said that the\r\nvegetarian Adhikāri, if he marries into a flesh-eating caste of\r\nthe Badagas, betakes himself to this latter very readily.” The\r\nKanakas are stated by Mr. Grigg to be the accountants, who were\r\nprobably introduced when the hills were under the sway of the Tamil\r\nchiefs. This would, however, seem to be very improbable. “The\r\nToreyas are regarded as sons and servants to the five high caste Badaga\r\nsects—to the Hāruvas especially. [74]They are\r\nthe lowest in the scale, and they are prohibited from intermarrying\r\nwith the other or high caste Badagas, as long as they are sons to\r\nthem.” The Toreya does the menial duties for the tribe. He is the\r\nvillage servant, carries the corpses to the burning-ground, conveys the\r\nnews of a death from village to village, is the first to get shaved\r\nwhen a death occurs, and is sent along with a woman when she is going\r\nto visit her mother or mother-in-law at a distance from her own home.\r\n“The Udayas, Adhikāris and Kanakas are Lingāyats in\r\nreligion, and the other three, the Hāruvas, Badagas, and Toreyas\r\nare Saivites.” Of the six divisions referred to, the Udayas and\r\nToreyas are endogamous, but intermarriage is permissible between the\r\nother four. At the census, 1891, a large number of Badagas returned as\r\ntheir sub-division Vakkaliga, which means cultivator, and is the name\r\nof the great cultivating caste of Mysore.",

		"description": "It is recorded, in the Gazetteer of the Vizagapatam district, that\r\n“throughout the Jeypore country proper, the Dombus (and some\r\nGhāsis) are by far the most troublesome class. Their favourite\r\ncrime is cattle-theft for the sake of the skins, but, in 1902, a Dombu\r\ngang in Naurangpūr went so far as to levy blackmail over a large\r\nextent of country, and defy for some months all attempts at capture.\r\nThe loss of their cattle exasperates the other hill folk to the last\r\ndegree, and, in 1899, the Naiks (headmen) of sixteen villages in the\r\nnorth of Jeypore tāluk headed an organized attack on the houses of\r\nthe Dombus, which, in the most deliberate manner, they razed to the\r\nground in some fifteen villages. The Dombus had fortunately got scent\r\nof what was coming, and made themselves scarce, and no bloodshed\r\noccurred. In the next year, some of the Naiks of the Rāmagiri side\r\nof Jeypore tāluk sent round a jack branch, a well-recognised form\r\nof the fiery cross, summoning villagers other than Dombus to assemble\r\nat a fixed time and place, but this was luckily intercepted by the\r\npolice. The Agent afterwards discussed the whole question with the\r\nchief Naiks of Jeypore and South Naurangpūr. They [184]had\r\nno opinion of the deterrent effects of mere imprisonment on the Dombus.\r\n‘You fatten them, and send them back,’ they said, and\r\nsuggested that a far better plan would be to cut off their right hands.\r\n[It is noted, in the Vizagapatam Manual, 1869, that in cases of murder,\r\nthe Rājah of Jeypore generally had the man’s hands, nose,\r\nand ears cut off, but, after all that, he seldom escaped the\r\ndeceased’s relatives.] They eventually proposed a plan of\r\nchecking the cattle-thefts, which is now being followed in much of that\r\ncountry. The Bāranaiks, or heads of groups of villages, were each\r\ngiven brands with distinctive letters and numbers, and required to\r\nbrand the skins of all animals which had died a natural death or been\r\nhonestly killed; and the possession by Dombus, skin merchants, or\r\nothers, of unbranded skins is now considered a suspicious circumstance,\r\nthe burden of explaining which lies upon the possessor. Unless this, or\r\nsome other way of checking the Dombus’ depredations proves\r\nsuccessful, serious danger exists that the rest of the people will take\r\nthe matter into their own hands and, as the Dombus in the Agency number\r\nover 50,000, this would mean real trouble.” It is further\r\nrecorded57 that the Paidis (Paidi Mālas), who often\r\ncommit dacoities on the roads, “are connected with the Dombus of\r\nthe Rāyagada and Gunupur tāluks, who are even worse. These\r\npeople dacoit houses at night in armed gangs of fifty or more, with\r\ntheir faces blacked to prevent recognition. Terrifying the villagers\r\ninto staying quiet in their huts, they force their way into the house\r\nof some wealthy person (for choice the local Sondi, liquor-seller and\r\nsowcar,58 usually the only man worth looting in an agency\r\nvillage, and a shark who gets little pity from his [185]neighbours when forced to disgorge), tie up the\r\nmen, rape the women, and go off with everything of value. Their\r\nfavourite method of extracting information regarding concealed property\r\nis to sprinkle the houseowner with boiling oil.”",

Great was the disgust of\r\nthe assembled males, on a certain day, when the record of hand-grip for\r\nthe morning (73 lbs.) was carried off by a big-boned female, who became\r\nthe unlovely heroine of the moment. The largest English feminine\r\nhand-grip, recorded in my laboratory note-book, is only 66 lbs. One\r\nToda man, of fine physique, not satisfied with his grip of 98 lbs.,\r\nwent into training, and fed himself up for a few days. Thus prepared,\r\nhe returned to accomplish 103 lbs., the result of more skilful\r\nmanipulation of the machine rather than of a liberal dietary of\r\nbutter-milk.",
